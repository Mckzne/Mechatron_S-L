The code has been tested on an ESP32 at data pin 12. It creates water-like waves in a Sea-blue hue, using an algorithm called Simplex Noise with custom brightness variations. To alter colours, add new functions with their corresponding RGB values to see extra colours as per use case. For geometric waves, use Perlin Noise instead. Note: To test the code, ensure all three code files are open in separate tabs within your sketch.
