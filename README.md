# Before you simply paste code

The repository contains Arduino sketches, built for ESP32 and Arduino Uno to simplify running simulations on multiple devices, enable the use of code for future iterations of the event and educational purposes. It assumes the successful integration and setup of the Arduino IDE on the device with the required libraries and drives installed. Instructions to install the Arduino IDE, required libraries etc will be found in the file. 
All codes are subject to change with respect to the data pin and number of LEDs preferred for each simulation. To understand the use case and a summary of what the code does, visit the Description.md of each folder.
