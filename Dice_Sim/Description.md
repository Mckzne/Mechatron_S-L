The code is tested on an Arduino UNO to simulate an animation and a random number generation. The code plays a Snake-slithering animation (with predefined mapped paths) across the face of a Mini Dice custom made with 200 LEDs taped onto a carboard box. The animation plays for 3 seconds and then generates a random number based on the 7 segment mapping of this face. A roll is triggered by the input 'R' into the serial monitor once prompted along with a display of the number generated. Auto rolls are prohibited. An upscaled version to a larger dice with different mappings can be made from this code.
